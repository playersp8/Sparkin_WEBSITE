                    We at Sparkin are currently developing a MOORPG game callled Legends of Dharma, which is based on India's Hindu Mythology. There will be multiple Multiplayer modes in this game and also a single player story mode, in which your character will be able to go in the world of the Indian Epics (Mythological Stories) and survive then and there. We are currently in the developing stage of the game.
